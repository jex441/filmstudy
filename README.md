# FilmStudy

## Watch better movies.

This is a mobile app using React Native which enables users to discover new films, track ones they have watched, create a watch list, and receive reccomendations based on their viewing history.

Queries are made to The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/) and it leverages a simple Express server with a Postgres database for handling data.

User authentication is a handle using a PassportJS local strategy of a two word passphrase and number. This is generated on the fly for new users to be as simple to use as possible.
